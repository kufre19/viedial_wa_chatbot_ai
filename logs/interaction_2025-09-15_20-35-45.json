  "response": "Diabetes can significantly impact brain health in several ways. Firstly, it can damage blood vessels in the brain, which might lead to a stroke or contribute to memory loss. This vascular damage is similar to how diabetes affects blood vessels elsewhere in the body. Additionally, diabetes can damage the nerves in the brain, much like how it affects nerves in other parts of the body due to high or low blood sugar levels. Both extremes of blood sugar can be harmful and lead to complications that affect brain function.\n\nIf you have more questions or concerns about how diabetes affects the brain or any other diabetes-related issues, you might want to ask your healthcare provider the following:\n1. How can I manage my blood sugar levels to protect my brain health?\n2. Are there specific symptoms of brain-related complications I should watch for?\n3. What lifestyle changes can I make to reduce the risk of diabetes-related brain damage?"
