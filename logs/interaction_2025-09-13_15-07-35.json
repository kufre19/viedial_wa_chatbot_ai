  "response": "Diabetes is a chronic medical condition where the body either cannot produce enough insulin or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. High blood sugar from diabetes can lead to severe health problems affecting nearly every major organ in the body, including the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes, and kidneys. Managing blood sugar levels is crucial for preventing these complications.\n\nHere are some follow-up questions you might want to ask:\n1. What are the different types of diabetes?\n2. How can I manage diabetes effectively?\n3. What are the common symptoms of diabetes I should watch out for?"
